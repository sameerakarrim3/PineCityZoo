                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. 
    Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, 
    in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included,
    monkeys and simians are synonyms.
    </p>
     <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm 
        (4+5/8 in) with a 172 mm (6+3/4 in) tail and just over 100 g (3+1‚ÅÑ2 oz) in weight,[45] to the male mandrill, 
        almost 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and weighing up to 36 kg (79 lb).[46] Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live 
        on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, 
        flowers, eggs and small animals
     </p>
   <p>Monkeys can live up to 20-27 years.
