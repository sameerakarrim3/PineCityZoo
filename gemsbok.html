                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx.
        Gemsbok are light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and 
        black in color. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the 
        front of both the front legs, and both sexes have long, straight horns.
    </p>
     <p>Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (4 ft) at the shoulder.[7][8] The body length can 
        vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm 18 to 35.
        the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters mistake females for males each year. 
        In males horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females have slightly longer, thinner horns.
     </p>
   <p>Gemsbok are found in arid and semi-arid bushlands in southwestern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts, 
    in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and formerly Angola
