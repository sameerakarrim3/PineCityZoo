                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, 
    is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs 
    and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m 
    (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. 
    A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. 
    It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. 
    It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.
    </p>
     <p>In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. 
    Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new 
    method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believed the wild population were as large as 3,000
     </p>
   <p>Pandas can live up to 20 years.
