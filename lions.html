                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
    broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. 
    It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
    forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. 
    Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. 
    The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
     <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. 
    The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are 
    generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen 
    on the legs and underparts.
     </p>
   <p>Lions can live up to 16 years, with some living even longer in captivity.
