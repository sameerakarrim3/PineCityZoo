                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>A warthog is part of the pig species and is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards. The lower pair, 
    which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened 
    and closed. The upper canine teeth can grow to 25.5 cm (10.0 in) long and have a wide elliptical cross section, being about 
    4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 2.5 cm (0.98 in) wide. A tusk will curve 90Â° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, 
    as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging,[6] but are used for combat with other hogs and 
    in defense against predators, the lower set can inflict severe wounds.
    </p>
     <p>Although capable of fighting (males fight each other during mating season), the common warthog's primary defense is to flee by 
    means of fast sprinting. When threatened, warthogs can run at speeds of up to 48 km/h (30 mph), they will run with their tails 
    sticking up and will enter their dens rear first with tusks facing out.
     </p>
   <p>Warthogs can live for up to 11-15 years and some can even live to 20 years.

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gorillas at F23, next to the giraffes.</p>
