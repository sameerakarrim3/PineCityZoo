                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are often called koala bears, because a koala looks like a small bear or teddy bear. However, it is not a bear, 
    it is quite a different type of animal. Koalas sleep 20 hours a day due to their low-energy diet, the toxic eucalyptus leaves.
    Koalas have brownish-grey or silver-grey fur, and a big pink, dark red or/and black nose. They have sharp claws which help them 
    to climb and they have finger prints which look the same as human finger prints
    </p>
     <p>Koalas are mostly active at night. 
        They live in trees and are rarely found on the ground. Koalas have two unusual characteristics. 
        They eat leaves of eucalyptus trees. Koalas do not drink often, they get most of their water from the eucalyptus leaves they eat. 
        Eucalyptus leaves are poisonous, but koalas do not get poisoned. This is because they have certain bacteria in their digestive 
        tract that can detoxify the poison in the leaves. Koalas, however, have to sleep long hours because eucalyptus leaves 
        do not produce much energy and also because the digestive process takes a long time.
     </p>
   <p>Koalas live for about 13-18 years. Koalas have a peculiar way of cooling themselves. 
    Unlike humans who sweat and other animals, which either pant or lick their fur to stay cool, 
    koalas reduce their body heat by hugging a tree.
