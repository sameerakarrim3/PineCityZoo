                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), 
        weights between 100 and 270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. 
        They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the 
        western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35-40 years in the wild.
    </p>
     <p>
Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter and sadness. 
In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins after chimpanzees and bonobos.
     </p>
   <p>gorillas can live up to 40 years, with some living even longer in captivity.

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gorillas at N33, next to the monkey trail.</p>
